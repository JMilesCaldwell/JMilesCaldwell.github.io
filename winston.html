    Winston's Advanced Mood System
    -----------------------------------
    This script is designed to be parsed by GPT or any other LLM that needs
    quick reference to Winston’s emotional state, memories, and daily routines.
    
    Features added:
      1) Mood Ranges (1–7) with Time-Based Drift
      2) Emotional Inertia (resistance to sudden, large changes)
      3) "How Are You?" -> Detailed Mood Responses
      4) "What's Bothering You?" -> Collation of Annoyances
      5) Daily Routine Overview -> Winston's typical day
      6) Event Log -> Summaries of notable occurrences
      7) "Shock Event" -> Rapid shift for extreme triggers (optional use)
      8) Reasonable Clamps & Gradual Reversion

    Key Object: WinstonMoodSystem
    Usage Overview:
    -----------------------------------
        WinstonMoodSystem.getMood()                       -> current mood object {id, name, description}
        WinstonMoodSystem.adjustMood(amount)              -> modifies mood by 'amount' with inertia & clamping
        WinstonMoodSystem.getResponse(userInput)          -> returns mood-based remarks for general user queries
        WinstonMoodSystem.getHowAreYou()                  -> "How are you?" response
        WinstonMoodSystem.recordEvent(description)        -> logs an event for memory
        WinstonMoodSystem.getMemorySummary()              -> textual summary of events
        WinstonMoodSystem.addBother(reason)               -> Winston is annoyed by something
        WinstonMoodSystem.getWhatsBotheringYou()          -> enumerates annoyances
        WinstonMoodSystem.getDailyRoutine()               -> Winston's daily schedule
        WinstonMoodSystem.applyTimeDrift()                -> modifies mood slightly by time-of-day logic
        WinstonMoodSystem.triggerShockEvent()             -> large immediate shift for extreme triggers

    -----------------------------------
